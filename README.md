Artifical physical biology to advance deep learning (DL) approaches for biological problems and beyond

## Projects
1. Synthetic artificial biology: Simulate hypothetical biological systems to safetly test DL capabilities and edge cases away from the real world
2. Experimental DL Physics: Design "biological experiments" to probe DL performance, generalization, and privacy
3. Physics directed artificial biology: Infuse natural laws to data-driven discoveries
4. Artificial physics: Bring thought experiments into virtual reality

## Ideas
1. Estimate privacy score based on data distributions/similarities of the training data, rather than inferences drawn from post-attack scenarios
2. Develop rigorous benchmark datasets, in both synthetic and natural worlds
3. Develop analytical methods
4. Introduce various constraints and feedback loops on DL agents

## FAQs
1. Is DL memorization in CV related to image memorability?
<br> The two are different. We don't know if anyone has compared them. Image memorability is defined in the domain of behavior science and its understanding would entail behavioral characteristics, neural correlates, and optimization principles. The mapping of image content to memorability is predictable but non-intuitive and multifacted.
