Artifical physical biology to advance deep learning (DL) approaches for biological problems and beyond

## Projects
1. Synthetic artificial biology: Simulate hypothetical biological systems to safetly test DL capabilities and edge cases away from the real world
2. DL performance, generalization, and privacy: Biology for DL
3. Physics directed artificial biology: Infuse natural laws to data-driven discoveries
4. Artificial physics: Thought experiments realized within computers

## Ideas
1. Estimate privacy score based on data distributions/similarities of the training data, rather than inferences drawn from post-attack scenarios
2. Develop rigorous benchmark datasets, in both synthetic and natural worlds
3. Develop analytical methods
4. Introduce various constraints and feedback loops on DL agents
