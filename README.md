# aiConfidential
Artifical physical biology to elucidate deep learning mechanics with physical theories and biological processes.

## Projects
1. Statistical Mechanics of Neural Networks: Predictive behaviors of stochastic networks
2. Experimental Biophysics of Deep Learning: Design "biological experiments" to probe DL performance, generalization, safety, and privacy
3. Artificial Biological Intelligence: Simulate hypothetical biological systems to test DL capabilities and edge cases away from the real world

## Ideas
1. Estimate privacy score based on data distributions/similarities of the training data, rather than inferences drawn from post-attack scenarios
   * inversion of pairwise distance matrices?
   * 
2. Develop rigorous benchmark datasets, in both synthetic and natural worlds
3. Develop relevant data analytic methods and model evaluation metrics
4. Introduce various constraints and feedback loops on DL agents
5. Simulate private stochastic gradient descent with evolutional dynamics in biology. Mutations essentially work as noises. Lead to phylogenetic tree in the end.
6. How do biological/physical systems preserve privacy? By relaxation, permutation, equilibrium?
7. Membership inference and reconstruction attacks
   1. define relative susceptibility based on distributions/neighborhoods
   2. implement as such for biological systems
   3. a way to cluster data, find and remove outliers
8. Invariant performance regardless of upsampling, stratificatoin, etc., suggesting the commonalities among data are first learned, and the rest is largely memorziation that has little generalization power
9. remove one cluster from training data has little effect on other clusters, this is very different from the onion effect where peripheral data points are removed
   1.  originiating from distinct privacy influence function?
10. Data poisoning, random noise addition, and base pair mutations

## FAQs
1. Is DL memorization in CV related to image memorability?
<br> The two are different. We don't know if anyone has compared them. Image memorability is defined in the domain of behavior science and its understanding would entail behavioral characteristics, neural correlates, and optimization principles. The mapping of image content to memorability is predictable but non-intuitive and multifacted.
